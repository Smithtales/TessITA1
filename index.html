areas of IT.

                      <p>Auditory</p>
                      <P>If you are an auditory learner, you learn by hearing
                        and listening. You understand and remember things you
                        have heard. You store information by the way it sounds,
                        and you have an easier time understanding spoken
                        instructions than written ones. You often learn by
                        reading out loud because you have to hear it or speak
                        it in order to know it.

As an auditory learner, you probably hum or talk to yourself or others if you
become bored. People may think you are not paying attention, even though you
may be hearing and understanding everything being said.</P>
