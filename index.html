<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
</div>
<div class="selecitonContent">
<p>I have been interested in IT for many years and had been doing unofficial
study via Udemy during the pandemic to gauge which areas I would most like to study.
Once I had a better idea of what I was interested in I enquired with Open Universities
and they helped me enrol in the right classes.
A lot of my friends have worked in different
areas of IT and it always seemed like something I would enjoy.
I chose RMIT because it has received glowine reports from other friends
who have attended.
I am particually interested in Cyber Security, I hope to use this class as a
launch pad to further study in that field.</p>

                      <p>Auditory</p>
                      <P>If you are an auditory learner, you learn by hearing
                        and listening. You understand and remember things you
                        have heard. You store information by the way it sounds,
                        and you have an easier time understanding spoken
                        instructions than written ones. You often learn by
                        reading out loud because you have to hear it or speak
                        it in order to know it.

As an auditory learner, you probably hum or talk to yourself or others if you
become bored. People may think you are not paying attention, even though you
may be hearing and understanding everything being said.</P>
