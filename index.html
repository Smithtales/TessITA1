<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
</div>
<div class="selecitonContent">
<p>I have been interested in IT for many years and had been doing unofficial
study via Udemy during the pandemic to gauge which areas I would most like to study.
Once I had a better idea of what I was interested in I enquired with Open Universities
and they helped me enrol in the right classes.
A lot of my friends have worked in different
areas of IT and it always seemed like something I would enjoy.
I chose RMIT because it has received glowine reports from other friends
who have attended.
I am particually interested in Cyber Security, I hope to use this class as a
launch pad to further study in that field.</p>

                      <p>Auditory</p>
                      <P>If you are an auditory learner, you learn by hearing
                        and listening. You understand and remember things you
                        have heard. You store information by the way it sounds,
                        and you have an easier time understanding spoken
                        instructions than written ones. You often learn by
                        reading out loud because you have to hear it or speak
                        it in order to know it.

As an auditory learner, you probably hum or talk to yourself or others if you
become bored. People may think you are not paying attention, even though you
may be hearing and understanding everything being said.</P>

                    <h2>Overview & Motivation</h2>
                    <p>Lots of people have pets, their health is important as valuable members of many families. With our busy lifestyles it is easy to let the less vocal members of our families health waver. While human health is an area that has many options for monitoring and tracking our own health, the health of our pets is not usually documented or tracked with the same frequency, granularity or accuracy. For our pets, this data is not regularly updated or collated. Without a system to make it easy to collect and share this information, vets also may not have the most up to date information. The software packages they use for storing or sharing this information on patient history make it difficult to share updates and care advice with their customers about their patient. I propose developing an app that consolidates all of this information at the press of a button,  that will collate all the care information on your pet, such as when they are due for checkups or when they have had their last vaccination.</p>

                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>To solve this problem, I propose developing a web-app that collects information supplied by the vet on each visit and stores it in an online database. The web app could also be paired with a smartphone app that provides the same functionality but in an easily accessible format.

                     The database will store the following information about each animal:
                    <ul>
                     <li>pets name</li>
                     <li>owner information</li>
                     <li>breed</li>
                     <li>age</li>
                     <li>gender</li>
                     <li>history</li>
                     <li>treatment history</li>
                     <li>billing information</li>
                     <li>medication</li>
                     <li>home care management plans</li>
                     <li>important dates and reminders</li>
                     <li>contact information</li>
                     <li>microchip data</li>
                     <li>vaccination  information and schedule</li>
                     <li>weight</li>
                     <li>activity levels</li>
                     <li>general demeanor</li>
                     <li>clinical notes</li>
                     <li>owner notes and observations</li>
                     <li>issues and incidents</li>
                    </ul>
                    The system will allow both the owner and the vet to be able to view, update and share the information in real-time to ensure the best care for the pet. Both vets and owners will be able to access and update the database via a web interface, or via the smartphone app.

                    Once access is granted, users will be able to interact 24 hours a day, 7 days a week with the database to ensure current information and alerts are able to be viewed as soon as it's needed.
                    The app can be linked to include payment options such as afterpay, payment agreements with the clinic, or credit cards to help pet owners manage the ongoing expenses of pet ownership and veterinary care.

                    Information in the system is also analysed to identify when urgent care alerts should be issued, and when appointments are coming up or have been missed. Threats are identified to the pet's health or wellbeing may include:
                    <ul>
                    <li>upcoming or missed vaccination appointments</li>
                    <li>changes in weight or activity levels</li>
                    <li>test results that require follow up or consultation</li>
                    <li>health alerts based on location and animal breed (such as viral outbreaks such as cat flu or myxomatosis)</li>
                    </ul>
                    The app will have different profiles for each animal, which would be especially beneficial for people with multiple pets. Owners could view individual profiles and reports detailing what each animal was treated for, what their ongoing health is expected to be and when they need a follow up visit. Owners could also access a breakdown of the expenses past, present, and future to help people navigate the day to day expenses of pet ownership.

                    Vets could prescribe medications and other care management activities such as weight and activity monitoring that the owner can perform at home. Once submitted buy the owner, this information is made available in real time to the vets and for analysis, reporting and alerts.

                    <li>A smartphone app capable of connecting to and providing up-to-the-minute data also needs to be developed to ensure ease of use.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h2>Skills</h2>
